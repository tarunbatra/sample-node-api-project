# N-API
This is just me trying my hands at N-API and C++ addons. Nothing to see here, unless you are intrigued too.

## Get started
Since the project uses N-API, it needs to be built before we can run it.
```
npm i && npm run build
```
And then,
```
npm start
```

## Source
This project is directly inspired from [Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v14.x/api/addons.html). They have good docs on N-API to get started.
